# The Challenge: Finding the Perfect Spot
Imagine you’re driving your electric car on a long highway, and the battery is running low. You desperately need a charging station, but they’re scarce. This is a problem many EV owners face, and as EVs rise in popularity, it's a challenge Germany is grappling with.

Our project, conducted as part of the E.ON Data Challenge, aimed to solve this problem. Partnering with E.ON, one of Germany’s leading energy providers, we identified the best places to install 1,000 new ultra-fast EV chargers nationwide.

# Our Goal:
To use machine learning and data analysis to predict the optimal locations for these chargers—locations that would ensure high utilization and ease of access for EV drivers. But we didn’t want just any locations. We needed places with existing infrastructure, easy accessibility, and the potential for long-term success.
